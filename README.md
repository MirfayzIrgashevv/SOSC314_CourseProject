# 📊 Understanding Review Helpfulness in Online Marketplaces

Even though online reviews are not equally helpful, they play important role when consumer is making decision. This project applies machine learning and text-as-data methods to examine how consumers express opinions in product reviews and how these expressions influence others

Using the **Amazon Fine Food Reviews dataset**, we perform sentiment analysis and investigate linguistic and stylistic features that affect how much value other users assign to a review.

## 🎯 Research Objectives

In addition to **sentiment analysis (positive vs. negative)**, this project addresses the following questions:

* **Are emotionally expressive reviews or informational reviews more helpful to consumers?**
* **Does review length increase perceived credibility and helpfulness?**
* **Are negative reviews perceived as more helpful than positive reviews?**

Together, these questions explore how **tone, content, and effort** shape trust in online reviews.
